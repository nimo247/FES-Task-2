FES NSUT is a student-driven organization focused on financial literacy and economic education. 
The website serves as a comprehensive hub for financial resources, market insights, and educational content.

The website features a sophisticated dark blue gradient theme that creates a professional, finance-focused aesthetic. 
our addition of light/dark mode functionality will significantly enhance user experience by providing viewing flexibility and accessibility options.

The layout demonstrates excellent information architecture with clear navigation between Home, Resources, and Contact sections, 
making it easy for students to access educational materials and stay updated with financial market trends.
